In my first year Introduction to Data-analytics course I typically have between twenty and thiryt student assistants to schedule. Finding a nice schedule that fits the preferences and availability of all student assistants, while ensuring that students have the same teacher for their different classes is a challenging puzzle.</p> <h2 id="scheduling-problem">Scheduling Problem</h2> <p>Due to my background in computer science and operations research, it is obvious to think about this scheduling problem in terms of mathematical optimization.</p> <p>Assume we have a set of bundles of teaching tasks $B$ and for each of those bundles $b_i \in B$ we have a minimal number $b_i$ of teaching assistants we want to assign to that bundle of tasks. Furthermore, we have a set of teaching assistants $T$ and for each teaching assistant $t \in T$, we then have a set $S_t$ of feasible schedules we can assign to that teaching assistant. For each schedule $s \in S_t$ and each bundle of tasks $b_i \in B$ we have an indicator variable $a_{s,i}$ which is $1$ is schedule $s$ contains task bundle $i$, and $0$ otherwise. Finally, for each schedule $s \in S_t$ we have a <em>preference score</em> $p_{t,s}$ indicating how attractive that particular schedule is.</p> <p>Putting all these variables together, allows us to write the scheduling problem using the following <em>schedule-oriented</em> formulation:</p> \[\begin{alignat}{2} \max &amp; \sum_{t \in T} \sum_{s \in S_t} p_{t,s} x_{t,s} &amp; &amp; \\ \text{s.t} &amp; \sum_{s \in S_t} x_{t,s} &amp; = 1 &amp; \forall t \in T \\ &amp; \sum_{t \in T} \sum_{s \in S_t} a_{s,i} x_{t,s} &amp; \geq b_i &amp; \forall i \in B \\ &amp; x_{s,t} &amp; \in \{0,1\} &amp; \forall t \in T, \forall s \in S_t \end{alignat}\] <p>There are some challenges when working with this formulation. First, the question is how to combine teaching tasks into bundles. Second, the number of feasible schedules for a particular TA can be gigantic if they are very flexible. Finally, we need to come up with a way in which to compute the <em>preference score</em>.</p> <p>A different formulation could be defined using decision variables that directly assign bundles to student assistants, rather than choosing one schedule per student assistant. We call this alternative formulation the <em>bundle oriented</em> formulation.</p> <h3 id="defining-bundles-of-teaching-tasks">Defining bundles of Teaching Tasks</h3> <p>As the teaching tasks of my largest courses can approach 500 tasks, defining bundles by hand is too cumbersome. I developed an algorithm that groups teaching tasks according to the <em>student group</em> and the <em>time of the activity in the week</em>. This generates for examples bundles that contain all tutorials for group EC01 from 9:00 - 11:00 on Tuesdays. Another bundle could be all tutorials for group EC02 from 13:00-15:00 on Thursdays.</p> <p>As some manual modification of a schedule is typically needed, the bundles of teaching tasks are assigned intuitive names, derived from the student groups. In the example above, we would have a bundle with name EC01-a and a bundle with name EC01-b. If for example all teaching activities of group EC02 would occur at the same time within each week, no suffix would be applied and the bundle is just called EC02.</p> <h3 id="determining-individual-schedules">Determining Individual Schedules</h3> <p>In practice I have had cases where some student assistants had only a handful of feasible schedules whereas others had millions. To determine whether a schedule is feasible, the following hard constraints are considered:</p> <ul> <li>The maximum total workload of the student assistant can not be violated</li> <li>The maximum weekly workload of the student assistant can not be violated</li> <li>No combinations of bundles that contain overlapping teaching activities can be within the same schedule</li> <li>No bundles that contain teaching activities at a time the student assistant is unavailable can be in their schedule</li> <li>The capabilities of the student assistant match those required for all teaching activities in the bundle (e.g. language related capabilities)</li> </ul> <p>Note that all these constraints can be easily taken into account in both the <em>schedule oriented</em> and the <em>bundle oriented</em> formulations. However, things become more complicated when we consider some soft constraints that we aim to take into account in the <em>preference score</em>.</p> <h3 id="determining-the-preference-scores">Determining the preference scores</h3> <p>We try to capture are number of factors in the <em>preference score</em>, some of which are preference from the side of the student assistant, while others are preferences for the students. The factors I currently consider are the following:</p> <ul> <li>The preferences of the student assistant for the time slots where they are available (on a 5-step scale)</li> <li>The preferences of the student assistant for particular types of student groups (e.g. fiscal economics vs regular economics)</li> <li>The preferences of the student assistant to perform different numbers of consecutive teaching tasks</li> <li>The preferences of the student assistant to perform teaching activities on different numbers of days within each week</li> <li>The number of times the student assistant teaches the exact same group of students</li> </ul> <p>As some of these preferences depend on exactly which bundles are selected together, including all these in the preference scores is significantly harder in the <em>bundle oriented</em> formulation.</p> <h2 id="software">Software</h2> <p>I have created multiple iterations of software for this scheduling process. I hope some day the latest iteration of this software will at some point be flexible and user friendly enough to use by colleagues. Currently, I have a tool that can convert a spreadsheet exported from our time tabling software to a scheduling instance. It can then use that instance to create a preferences survey to be filled in by the student assistants. Using the data from these surveys, a schedule can be made by dragging and dropping task bundles in a table format, where the total preference scores as well as the violations of constraints are immediately indicated by the software. There is also an option to run a few steps of a greedy heurstics. Hopefully, smarted approaches can be added to the software in the future.</p> <figure> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/teaching_taschedule_screenshot1.jpg" alt="A large grid with many cells indicating availability of student assistants and tasks assigned to them"> <figcaption class="caption">Screenshot of a scheduling instance within the scheduling software.
