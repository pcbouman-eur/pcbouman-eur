## PhD Supervision

* (2020-now) I am the daily supervisor of Mette Wagenvoort [(project page)](/projects/phd_mette)
* (2017-2022) I was the daily supervisor of Rolf van Lieshout [(project page)](/projects/phd_rolf)

## Master Thesis Supervision

This is a list of students who *completed* their Master Thesis under my supervision within the [Master Program in Econometrics and Management Science](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/econometrics). I have added the year in which the student has defended the thesis, as well as a link to the thesis on Erasmus University's thesis hub if available. Theses I co-read have been omitted.
