## Master Thesis Supervision

This is a list of students who *completed* their Master Thesis under my supervision within the [Master Program in Econometrics and Management Science](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/econometrics). I have added the year in which the student has defended the thesis, as well as a link to the thesis on Erasmus University's thesis hub if available. Theses I co-read have been omitted.

## Workshops and Tutorials

I designed and gave a workshop on terminal skills for cloud computing organized by the student association FAECTOR. The [workshop materials](https://pcbouman-eur.github.io/workshop-getting-started-cloud/) are publicly available.

I gave a short tutorial on mathematical optimization during the Winter Workshop on Complex Systems 2022. The [materials of the tutorial](https://github.com/pcbouman-eur/wwcs2022-mathprog-tutorial) are publicly available.

For a number of years, I gave a tutorial on using CPLEX with Java to the students of the Quantitative Methods for Logistics Course. The [materials of the tutorial](https://pcbouman-eur.github.io/JavaCplexExample/) are publicly available.

## Courses at Utrecht University

I was a teaching assistant between 2004 and 2011 for various courses at the [Department of Information and Computing Sciences of Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-information-and-computing-sciences).
These courses include:

* Imperative programming (2 times)
* Computer architecture and networks (3 times)
* Databases
* Graphics
* Search algorithms (4 times)
* Data structures
* Mathematical techniques for computing science (2 times)
* Logic & Set Theory (3 times)
* Expert Systems (2 times)
* Functional programming
* Internet Programming (2 times)
* Distributed Programming
* Strategic Management and ICT

For the Strategic Management and ICT course, I developed software used to play an immersive classroom business simulation game.
