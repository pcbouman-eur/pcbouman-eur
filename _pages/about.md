This is the professional webpage of Paul Bouman. I am currently employed as an [Assistant Professor at the Erasmus School of Economics](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/people/paul-bouman).

From a young age, I have been fascinated by the innovations and possibilities enabled by computers, and I knew early on I wanted to study Computer Science. During my Bachelor's studies at Utrecht University, I did a minor in Artificial Intelligence and worked on software for AIBO robots. During my Master's studies on Applied Computing Sciences I wrote a [thesis on Recoverable Robust optimization](/assets/pdf/msc-thesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}. I did my PhD at Erasmus University Rotterdam within the [Complexity in Public Transport project](/projects/phd_computr) funded by NWO and completed my PhD thesis "[Passengers, Crowding and Complexity](https://repub.eur.nl/pub/100767)" in 2017.

In my professional work I enjoy working on algorithm design and the implementation of algorithms. During my PhD I learned to appreciate the challenges we face when humans have to make use of algorithms and the impact this has both on a local scale (can users or companies use a system) and on a large scale (does a new system benefit society). I commonly study questions related to this in the context of logistics and the allocation of scarce resources. More details of some of my research can be found on the [projects page](/projects). I have served as a reviewer to high impact journals, such as [Transportation Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/trsc), [Transportation Research: Part B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/transportation-research-part-b-methodological), [Computers and Operations Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-and-operations-research), [Omega](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/omega) and the [European Journal on Operational Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/european-journal-of-operational-research), among others.

I teach two large Bachelor courses involving computer skills, including Java programming. I also supervise Master's theses to students in the [Analytics and Operations Research In Logistics](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/analytics-and-operations-research-logistics) and [Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/business-analytics-and-quantitative-marketing) programs. I also enjoy applying my skills in combinatorial optimization to make different tools surrounding the logistics of teaching, such as allocation student assistants to scheduled classes.
