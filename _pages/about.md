This is the professional webpage of Paul Bouman. I am currently employed as an [Assistant Professor at the Erasmus School of Economics](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/people/paul-bouman). My primary research interests are related to algorithm design and mathematical and combinatorial optimization. Commonly I study these techniques in the context of logistics, in particular public transport. I teach two large Bachelor courses involving computer skills, including Java programming. I also supervise Master's theses to students in the [Analytics and Operations Research In Logistics](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/analytics-and-operations-research-logistics) and [Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/business-analytics-and-quantitative-marketing) programs.

From a young age, I have been fascinated by the innovations and possibilities enabled by computers. As a consequence, it was only logical to study Computer Science. During my Bachelor's studies at Utrecht University, I did a minor in Artificial Intelligence and worked on software for AIBO robots. During my Master's studies on Applied Computing Sciences I wrote a thesis on Recoverable Robust optimization. I did my PhD at Erasmus University Rotterdam within the Complexity in Public Transport project funded by the original Complexity program of NWO and completed my PhD thesis "Passengers, Crowding and Complexity" in 2017.
