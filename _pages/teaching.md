## Courses at Erasmus University

This is a list of the courses I have taught at Erasmus University Rotterdam.

* **FEB22012(X) Programming** *2016-now (Course Coordinator, Lecturer)*. The second course on Java followed by students in both the Dutch and International version of the [Bachelor Econometrics and Operations Research](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/bachelor/international-bachelor-econometrics-and-operations-research). It focuses on Object Oriented Programming in Java and deals with topics such as *interfaces*, *inheritance*, *class hierarchies*, *lambda's* and more. Since 2021 the course has a [public website with written course materials](https://feb22012.ese.eur.nl).
* **FEB11013(X) Introduction to Data-analytics** *2017-now (Course Coordinator)*. A first year course followed by students in both the Dutch and International version of the [Bachelor Economics and Business Economics](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/bachelor/international-bachelor-economics-and-business-economics). It teaches basic computational concepts (variables, conditional execution, loops, lists) and then moves to teaching Microsoft Excel. Some introductory concepts related to computer security, the organisation of the Internet and the differences between Spreadsheets and Databases are also discussed.
* **FEB23007 Advanced Programming** *2017 (Course Coordinator, Lecturer)*. A third year Bachelor course I taught one year. Because of a swap in course contents the contents were the same as FEB22012, but I added an extra part and assignment on optimization and working with a Solver.
* **RSMME011 Elective Big data and business analytics** 2014 (Tutorial Development, Tutorials) A Master Elective in which students in the [MSc Business Information Management](https://www.rsm.nl/education/master/msc-programmes/msc-business-information-management/) had to work in Python for the first time. Due to a last moment staff dropout, developing tutorial content was a hectic, but educational experience to learn course development.
* **Mathematics** 2012-2013 (Tutorials) I assisted teaching basic mathematics to first year students in the Dutch version of the [BSc Business Administration](https://www.rsm.nl/education/bachelor/bsc-bedrijfskunde-business-administration-ba/)
* **Decision Support** 2012-2013 (Tutorials) I assisted teaching decision tools, including decision trees, game theory and project planning and simulation to first year students in the Dutch version of the [BSc Business Administration](https://www.rsm.nl/education/bachelor/bsc-bedrijfskunde-business-administration-ba/)

### Projects and Awards

I have redesigned the FEB22012(X) Programming and FEB11013(X) Introduction to Data-analytics courses from scratch. I have run numerous innovation projects to improve these courses.

I was **awarded the teaching innovation award of the Erasmus School of Economics in 2017** for introducing automated feedback in the FEB22012 Programming Course together with Gert-Jan van den Burg.

I was **awarded the teaching innovation award of the Erasmus School of Economics in 2018** for redesign of FEB11013 Introduction to Data-analytics courses together with Kim Schouten (the name of the course was ICT back then).

## Workshops and Tutorials

I designed and gave a workshop on terminal skills for cloud computing organized by the student association FAECTOR. The [workshop materials](https://pcbouman-eur.github.io/workshop-getting-started-cloud/) are publicly available.

I gave a short tutorial on mathematical optimization during the Winter Workshop on Complex Systems 2022. The [materials of the tutorial](https://github.com/pcbouman-eur/wwcs2022-mathprog-tutorial) are publicly available.

For a number of years, I gave a tutorial on using CPLEX with Java to the students of the Quantitative Methods for Logistics Course. The [materials of the tutorial](https://pcbouman-eur.github.io/JavaCplexExample/) are publicly available.

## Courses at Utrecht University

I was a teaching assistant between 2004 and 2011 for various courses at the [Department of Information and Computing Sciences of Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-information-and-computing-sciences).
These courses include:

* Imperative programming (2 times)
* Computer architecture and networks (3 times)
* Databases
* Graphics
* Search algorithms (4 times)
* Data structures
* Mathematical techniques for computing science (2 times)
* Logic & Set Theory (3 times)
* Expert Systems (2 times)
* Functional programming
* Internet Programming (2 times)
* Distributed Programming
* Strategic Management and ICT

For the Strategic Management and ICT course, I developed software used to play an immersive classroom business simulation game.
