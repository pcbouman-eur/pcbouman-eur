Together with Dennis Huisman and Marjan van den Akker, I was the daily supervisor of Rolf van Lieshout between 2017 and 2022.

Rolf [graduated cum laude on Friday the 13th of May 2022](https://www.erim.eur.nl/research/news/detail/5455-phd-defence-rolf-van-lieshout/).

His thesis [Integration, Decentralization and Self-Organization: Towards Better Public Transport](https://pure.eur.nl/en/publications/integration-decentralization-and-self-organization-towards-better) received an honourable mention in the prestigious [TSL Dissertation Award competition](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/news/alumnus-rolf-van-lieshout-receives-honourable-mention-tsl-dissertation-award-competition).

Rolf is currently working as an [assistant professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/rolf-van-lieshout/).

## Thesis Abstract

> Public transport brings undisputed benefits to modern-day societies. Aside from providing an affordable means to get around, its supreme efficiency in comparison with private transport plays a crucial role in curbing congestion and pollution, highlighting the importance of adequate design and operation of public transport systems.
>
>The first part of this thesis seeks to improve the planning process of public transport operators by integrating planning steps that are traditionally performed sequentially. The first study considers a combination of line planning and vehicle scheduling, and presents methods that estimate how many vehicles are required to operate a line plan, without having to compute a timetable. The second study combines timetabling and vehicle scheduling, and develops a novel optimization model for jointly optimizing a periodic timetable and vehicle circulation schedule.
>
> The second part of this thesis investigates decentralized strategies for operating public transport, with a focus on railway systems. Such strategies could be preferable over conventional centralized and schedule-based control in various scenarios. The first study in this part presents a theoretical analysis of a simple, decentralized strategy for dispatching vehicles. The second study considers the application of decentralized control to out-of-control situations in railways, which includes the development of a solution algorithm to find line plans that are suited for these circumstances. The final study in this thesis tests decentralized dispatching of both vehicles and crew in a microscopic railway simulation.

## Research output

I was co-author of four papers Rolf worked on during his PhD:

* [A next step in disruption management: combining operations research and complexity science](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12469-021-00261-5) in *Public Transport* (Volume 14, Issue 1, March 2022, Pages 5-26)
* [A self-organizing policy for vehicle dispatching in public transit systems with multiple lines](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.004) in *Transportation Research Part B: Methodological* (Volume 152, October 2021, Pages 46-64)
* [Vehicle Scheduling Based on a Line Plan](https://doi.org/10.4230/OASIcs.ATMOS.2018.15) in *18th Workshop on Algorithmic Approaches for Transportation  Modelling, Optimization, and Systems (ATMOS 2018)* (Helsinki, Finland, 23-24 August 2018)

## Societal Impact

Rolf's research was featured in the nationwide Dutch newspaper Trouw [(article on EUR.nl with a PDF version)](https://www.eur.nl/en/news/during-big-ns-disruption-deployment-station-managers-could-help) [(article on Trouw.nl, behind a paywall)](https://www.trouw.nl/economie/wat-als-de-ns-nog-zo-n-technische-storing-krijgen-zo-kunnen-sommige-treinen-toch-rijden-volgens-deze-onderzoeker~b359c5cc/). Trouw won the European Newspaper Award in the nationwide category in 2001 and 2012.
