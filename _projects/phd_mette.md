Together with Kerry Malone and Martijn van Ee I am the daily supervisor of [Mette Wagenvoort](https://www.erim.eur.nl/people/mette-wagenvoort/). She is working on the project *Optimal planning of dispersed operations in urban coastal environments*. 

This is a joint project with TNO and The Netherlands Defence Academy.

## Abstract of the Project Proposal

> In this research we will focus on scheduling military operations in littoral environments. We will
> consider two phases of littoral operations, the ship-to-shore phase and the operation on land. In
> the ship-to-shore phase, resources have to be transported from amphibious warfare ships to land
> using smaller ships and connectors. In the operation on land tasks have to be executed. A new
> type of land operations which has not be quantitatively analysed are dispersed land operations.
> In dispersed land operations tasks are performed in smaller units while ensuring that units are
> close enough to neighbouring units such that units can help each other if necessary. A good
> planning for such operations can help in executing the tasks of the operation effciently as well
> as limit the risk of the operation.
>
> In this research we aim to cover both aspects of the operation, the ship-to-shore phase and the
> (dispersed) operation on land. Some research has been done on optimising the ship-to-shore
> phase, however we will consider constraints that are not covered in these methods. Dispersed
> land operations has, to the authors' knowledge, not been studied quantitatively yet. Studying
> this problem is of interest to give insight in the feasibility of using this type of land operations.
